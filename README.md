# Filament Samples

Generator to add text to the [Filament Sample | Crystal collector](https://makerworld.com/en/models/69402) model from SavageLau. By using OpenSCAD this is possible without the need for paid or cloud CAD software.

The `generate.ts` file reads the list of filaments in `samples.csv` and generates all the STL files, storing them in the `stl` folder.
